# Context-Free-Language
A context-free grammar is a set of recursive rules used to generate patterns of string. 
Context-free grammars are used to describe context-free languages. 
 The set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by 
pushdown automata, and the set of regular languages is a subset of context-free languages. All 
regular languages are context-free languages, but not all context-free languages are regular. 
Context-free grammars are the fundamental tool used to describe the syntax of a 
programming language. They are much more powerful than regular expressions, but, partly 
because of that power, require significantly more careful care and feeding than regular 
expressions. 
# Aim
Algorithm's aim is to check if the input string belongs to the language generated by 
given context-free grammar. 
CFG form and language that belongs to that grammar is kept in a text file named CFG.text,
rules can be changed by the user by adjusting text file.
